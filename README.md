## Features
### Clock
The starting page displays a button containing the current time. Clicking on the button changes between 12 and 24 Hour time formats.
### Alarm
On the alarm page, a user can add an alarm and must choose a time and day to successfully set the alarm. The set alarm is then added to a display list, and a user can add multiple alarms.
Clicking on an alarm gives the user the choice of editing or deleting the alarm.
